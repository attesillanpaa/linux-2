# Multiple formats

This material is intended to be useful in multiple contexts.
Below are some examples.

# Online Study group format

Programming is best learned by doing. During the first week the
students read the material and do the exercises independently. The
second week of the course adds lectures and discussion in the form of
online meetings.


# Independent study

Independent does not mean alone, quite the opposite. Please answer
the questions in the lecture notes and do the exercises together in
small groups and/or use the course discussion forum to exchange ideas
and ask for help. The lecturers follow the forum too, to comment and
help if needed.

A good effort is about 90 minutes each day. Some subjects may take
less, some more. The important thing is to devote some time for the
study each day during the course.

# A fair warning

Some of the questions and exercises may be really hard. In the worst
case they may even require you to read lecturers mind. This is
intentional. If you get stuck, start a thread in the discussion forum,
and go to the next question or exercise. Return to the hard problem
when you get some help on how to proceed.

Most importantly, be brave to ask questions, and help your fellow's
when they get stuck.
